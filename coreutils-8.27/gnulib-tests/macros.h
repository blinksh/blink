/* ASSERT (condition);
   verifies that the specified condition is fulfilled.  If not, a message
   is printed to ASSERT_STREAM if defined (defaulting to stderr if
   undefined) and the program is terminated with an error code.

   This macro has the following properties:
     - The programmer specifies the expected condition, not the failure
       condition.  This simplifies thinking.
     - The condition is tested always, regardless of compilation flags.
       (Unlike the macro from <assert.h>.)
     - On Unix platforms, the tester can debug the test program with a
       debugger (provided core dumps are enabled: "ulimit -c unlimited").
     - For the sake of platforms where no debugger is available (such as
       some mingw systems), an error message is printed on the error
       stream that includes the source location of the ASSERT invocation.
