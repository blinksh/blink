	  <h2>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
	  <p style="text-align: center;">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

	  <p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	    &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>
	    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

	  <h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>

	  <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
	    software and other kinds of works.</p>

	  <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
	    to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
	    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
	    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
	    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
	    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
	    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
	    your programs, too.</p>

	  <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
	    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
	    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
	    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
	    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
	    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

	  <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
	    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
	    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
	    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

	  <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
	    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
	    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
	    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
	    know their rights.</p>

	  <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
	    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
	    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

	  <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
	    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
	    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
	    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
	    authors of previous versions.</p>

	  <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
	    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
	    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
	    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
	    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
	    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
	    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
	    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
	    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
	    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

	  <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
	    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
	    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
	    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
	    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
	    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

	  <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	    modification follow.</p>

	  <h3><a name="terms"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

	  <h3><a name="section0"></a>0. Definitions.</h3>

	  <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

	  <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
	    works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>

	  <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
	    License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
	    &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p>

	  <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
	    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
	    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the
	    earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>

	  <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
	    on the Program.</p>

	  <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
	    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
	    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
	    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
	    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
	    public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

	  <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
	    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
	    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

	  <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo;
	    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
	    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
	    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
	    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
	    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
	    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
	    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h3>

	  <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work
	    for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
	    form of a work.</p>

	  <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
	    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
	    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
	    is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

	  <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
	    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
	    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
	    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
	    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
	    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
	    &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
	    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
	    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
	    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

	  <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
	    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
	    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
	    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
	    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
	    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
	    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
	    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
	    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
	    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
	    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
	    subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

	  <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
	    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
	    Source.</p>

	  <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
	    same work.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h3>

	  <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
	    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
	    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
	    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
	    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
	    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
	    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

	  <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
	    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
	    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
	    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
	    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
	    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
	    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
	    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
	    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
	    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

	  <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
	    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
	    makes it unnecessary.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h3>

	  <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
	    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
	    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
	    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
	    measures.</p>

	  <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
	    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
	    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
	    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
	    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
	    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
	    technological measures.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h3>

	  <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
	    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
	    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
	    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
	    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
	    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
	    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

	  <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
	    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h3>

	  <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
	    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
	    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
	      it, and giving a relevant date.</li>

	    <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
	      released under this License and any conditions added under section
	      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
	      &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li>

	    <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
	      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
	      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
	      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
	      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
	      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
	      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

	    <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
	      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
	      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
	      work need not make them do so.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
	    works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
	    and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
	    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
	    &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
	    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
	    beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
	    in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
	    parts of the aggregate.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section6"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h3>

	  <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
	    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
	    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
	    in one of these ways:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
	      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
	      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
	      customarily used for software interchange.</li>

	    <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
	      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
	      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
	      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
	      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
	      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
	      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
	      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
	      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
	      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
	      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

	    <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
	      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
	      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
	      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
	      with subsection 6b.</li>

	    <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
	      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
	      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
	      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
	      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
	      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
	      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
	      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
	      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
	      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
	      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
	      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

	    <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
	      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
	      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
	      charge under subsection 6d.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
	    from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
	    included in conveying the object code work.</p>

	  <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
	    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
	    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
	    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
	    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
	    product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
	    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
	    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
	    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
	    is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
	    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
	    the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

	  <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
	    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
	    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
	    a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
	    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
	    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
	    modification has been made.</p>

	  <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
	    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
	    part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
	    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
	    fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
	    Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
	    by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
	    if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
	    modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
	    been installed in ROM).</p>

	  <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
	    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
	    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
	    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
	    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
	    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
	    protocols for communication across the network.</p>

	  <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
	    in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
	    documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
	    source code form), and must require no special password or key for
	    unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h3>

	  <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
	    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
	    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
	    be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
	    that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
	    apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
	    under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
	    this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

	  <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
	    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
	    it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
	    removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
	    additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
	    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

	  <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
	    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
	    that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
	      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

	    <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
	      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
	      Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

	    <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
	      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
	      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

	    <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
	      authors of the material; or</li>

	    <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
	      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

	    <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
	      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
	      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
	      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
	      those licensors and authors.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
	    restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
	    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
	    governed by this License along with a term that is a further
	    restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
	    a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
	    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
	    of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
	    not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

	  <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
	    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
	    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
	    where to find the applicable terms.</p>

	  <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
	    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
	    the above requirements apply either way.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h3>

	  <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
	    provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
	    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
	    this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
	    paragraph of section 11).</p>

	  <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
	    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
	    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
	    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
	    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
	    prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

	  <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
	    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
	    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
	    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
	    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
	    your receipt of the notice.</p>

	  <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
	    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
	    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
	    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
	    material under section 10.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h3>

	  <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
	    run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
	    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
	    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
	    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
	    modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
	    not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
	    covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h3>

	  <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
	    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
	    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
	    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

	  <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
	    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
	    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
	    work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
	    transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
	    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
	    give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
	    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
	    the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

	  <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
	    rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
	    not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
	    rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
	    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
	    any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
	    sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h3>

	  <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
	    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
	    work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p>

	  <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims
	    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
	    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
	    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
	    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
	    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
	    purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
	    patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
	    this License.</p>

	  <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
	    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
	    make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
	    propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

	  <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
	    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
	    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
	    sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
	    party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
	    patent against the party.</p>

	  <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
	    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
	    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
	    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
	    then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
	    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
	    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
	    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
	    license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
	    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
	    covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
	    in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
	    country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>

	  <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
	    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
	    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
	    receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
	    or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
	    you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
	    work and works based on it.</p>

	  <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within
	    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
	    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
	    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
	    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
	    in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
	    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
	    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
	    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
	    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
	    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
	    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
	    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
	    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

	  <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
	    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
	    otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h3>

	  <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
	    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
	    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
	    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
	    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
	    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h3>

	  <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
	    permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
	    under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
	    combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
	    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
	    but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
	    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
	    combination as such.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h3>

	  <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
	    the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
	    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
	    address new problems or concerns.</p>

	  <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
	    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
	    Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the
	    option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
	    version or of any later version published by the Free Software
	    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
	    GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
	    by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

	  <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
	    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
	    public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
	    to choose that version for the Program.</p>

	  <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
	    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
	    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
	    later version.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h3>

	  <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
	    APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
	    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY
	    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
	    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
	    IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
	    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section16"></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h3>

	  <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
	    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
	    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
	    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
	    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
	    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
	    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
	    SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

	  <h3><a name="section17"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h3>

	  <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
	    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
	    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
	    an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
	    Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
	    copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

	  <p>The following additional terms (Additional Terms) supplement and modify the

		of the code used other than OpenSSL. If you modify file(s) with this
		exception, you may extend this exception to your version of the

		so, delete this exception statement from your version. If you delete
		this exception statement from all source files in the program, then

	    rights granted under Blink Shell's license, the GNU General Public License,
	    version 3. The Blink Shell copyright holders do not wish this conflict to
	    prevent the otherwise-compliant distribution of Blink Shell-derived apps via
	    the App Store. Therefore, we have committed not to pursue any license
	    violation that results solely from the conflict between the GPLv3 and
	    the Apple App Store terms of service. In other words, as long as you
	    comply with the GPL in all other respects, including its requirements
	    to provide users with source code and the text of the license, we will
	    not object to your distribution of Blink Shell through the App Store.

          <h3>AMSFonts (v. 2.2) copyright</h3>

          <p>The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the AMSFonts produced by and
          previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&amp;Y, Inc. are now freely
          available for general use. This has been accomplished through the
          cooperation
          of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research and Y&amp;Y.
          Members of this consortium include:

          Elsevier Science IBM Corporation Society for Industrial and Applied
          Mathematics (SIAM) Springer-Verlag American Mathematical Society (AMS)

          In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be
          held by
          the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any way
          the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
          distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
          into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
          applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
          faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
          removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
          any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
          Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
          has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
          given a different name.</p>
