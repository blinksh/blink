Although the Amazon Alexa-enabled devices are compatible with the Blink System, you do not need one of these gadgets to use the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/blinkappforpc">Blink cameras App</a>. Any iOS mobile device running version 12.5 or above, Android mobile devices operating version 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher, and Fire OS portable devices running software version 5.1 or higher are now compatible with the Blink App.

Is everything I need included with this system? Can I access it anywhere outside the house to keep an eye on it? Do I need to construct a module with additional equipment?
