This is a very important release with just a single change. We had to rewrite
all our legendary keyboard code so that features like caps as control could
continue working on iOS 13. If you use a keyboard in a different language,
specially with accents and special characters, we need your help more than ever.
Here is what’s new:

- Caps as Control or escape is back!
- You can now also define what individual modifier keys do on presses. Want to
  press Caps and send escape? No problem!
- You can separate left and right modifiers. And even define key ups and downs.
- Shortcuts can now also be configured and redefined.
- You can now also assign a different key to Escape.
- You can also assign Ctrl-Space (emacs & tmux mark) to a different sequence
  within Blink.
- Accents are now considered too for specific sequences so if you have an
  international keyboard like French, Danish, etc... let us know how things are
  looking like.

The road to 12. This is the version many have been waiting for. SSH is crucial
for Blink, so not only we are supercharging and getting ahead of everyone else,
we will also be ahead in the future. This release has a lot of under the covers
work to set the basis of what Blink will become in the future, so stay tuned!
Here is what is new and what we would like you to help us out testing:

- Support for new keys, including ECDSA and Ed25519! (DSA too, but you shouldn't
  be using that).
- Keys can now also be files stored on ~/.ssh within Blink. Please note those
  keys are not stored within the Secure Enclave, but you can always import them
  in Blink.
- Port Forwarding! Tunnel to a remote server using the usual -L and -R. Supports
  both direct/reverse!
- ProxyCommand support! (We are working on the agent and it should be ready
  before release).
- SSH connections should now last a lot longer too, without any tricks.
- Libssh supported ciphers, etc...
- SSH should now support piping with > and better exec commands.
- Resolving addresses within a VPN should now work better.
- Support for -o parameters within ssh (keep alive, etc...)
- Tuned authentication methods to be more in line with OpenSSH.
- Better verbose output with -v[vvvvv]

And then some more:

- Support to move sessions between screens when using AirTerminals.
- We have improved the speed of the main loop for ssh and now in many cases, it
  is even faster than Mosh for daily use.
- Fixed IPv6 addresses for Mosh.
- Fixed issue for servers without a password. Fixed ^L in built-in shell
  temporarily changing linefeed handling.
- Blink Keys stored within the Secure Enclave won't offer the passphrase option
  as that was redundant (the Secure Enclave already encrypts in hardware).
- iOS tuning and more general performance tweaks.
- We will keep libssh2 based version as ssh2 command.

# Version 11

- New Rendering engine. Smoother, faster and more accurate. We improved it so
  much that you may not need a new iPad next week. We had to go to desktop apps
  to compare the speed. Blink is now many times faster than Hyper.js and even
  faster than iTerm 2 long renderings. Big kudos to Yury for his outstanding
  work on this.
- Inertial Scrolling and Mouse events! As part of changing our rendering engine,
  we now support Inertial scrolling and mousedown and mouseup events. We will
  continue improving mouse support in next versions.
- Drag & Drop text from and to Blink.
- UNIX tools: You can now curl, scp, sftp, telnet, cd, ping, nc... I know what
  you are typing... telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl :)
- File Management: Blink's sandbox is now accessible within your device so you
  can operate with your files. Want to send something to a different app? Use
  the "open" command!
- iCloud Drive: Blink is now connected to iCloud Drive! You can seamlessly copy
  files from your iMac or any other devices to the Blink container.
- Linking to other apps: We took that further, and you can also "mount" other
  apps within Blink! You can now grep your git repositories from Working Copy,
  or curl a file and drop it to a different app!
- Better shell: We dropped linenoise and use REPL. We now have better
  autocompletions, "Reverse Search" and pipe commands or files!
- We have enabled ssh compression by default to increase speed.
- Multiple fixes and bugs crashed.

# Version 0.504

  Unicode, color rendering.

# Version 0.429

The purpose of this build is to test our Mosh version in real life scenarios
that could help us identify errors and misbehaviours. Sorry if there are no
bells and whistles yet, we want everyone to focus on stabilising our Mosh
changes.

## What to test:

- Problems establishing a connection, multiple concurrent sessions open, closing
  connections correctly, reconnecting after long periods...
- Keyboard support: For this version we have configured Ctrl, Cmd and Caps as
  Ctrl, Alt as meta.
- Terminal rendering glitches: Unicode, color rendering, garbled rendering...
