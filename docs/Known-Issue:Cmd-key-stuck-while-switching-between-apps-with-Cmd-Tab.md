After switching apps with the `Cmd-Tab` shortcut, when you return to the same app, the `Cmd` key is still pressed and the shortcuts help window shown. You can then press `w`, `t`, etc without having the Cmd key pressed.

This is a known issue within iOS13, and to get Apple to solve it we need your help. Please create a bug report within [Feedback Assistant](feedbackassistant.apple.com). We suggest that you use a similar title to ours: "Cmd key stuck while switching between apps with Cmd-Tab".

Here are two recordings that show the issue: `Cmd-tab` in [Pages.app](https://youtu.be/x0foV_ONDmk) & `Cmd-tab` in [Safari](https://youtu.be/-7LayQvtmPQ)

Thanks!
