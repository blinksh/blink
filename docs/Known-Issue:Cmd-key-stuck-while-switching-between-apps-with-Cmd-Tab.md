After switching apps with the Cmd-Tab shortcut, when you return to the same app, the Cmd key is still pressed and the shortcuts help window shown. You can then press w, t, etc without having the Cmd key pressed.

This is a known issue within iOS13, and to get Apple to solve it we need your help. Please create a bug report within feedbackassistant.apple.com. We suggest that you use a similar title to ours: Cmd key stuck while switching between apps with Cmd-Tab.

Here are two recordings that show the issue:
Cmd-tab in pages.app https://youtu.be/x0foV_ONDmk
Cmd-tab in safari https://youtu.be/-7LayQvtmPQ

Thanks!
